Do Diet Drinks Cause Weight Gain? 

A project by Shimun Naher

Overview: 
Though artificially-sweetened diet drinks (like Diet Pepsi or a cup of coffee with sucralose) contain no calories, it is theorized that drinking sweet diet drinks could increase cravings for other sweet food, or that the artificial sweeteners in diet drinks (like aspartame and sucralose) could directly cause weight gain. This article (http://www.vox.com/2016/11/28/13764656/diet-soda-metabolism-weight-loss-obesity) summarizes some of the recent research activity. 
Here I will use hypothesis testing to replicate some of the analysis in this study 
(http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1038/oby.2008.284/full). The original dataset is called the San Antonio Heart Study. It tracks 3,371 people living in San Antonio, Texas, over 7-8 years. For each person, it records (among many other things) how many diet drinks they reported drinking in a typical week, and the change in the person's Body Mass Index (BMI, a measure of weight adjusted for height) between the start and the end of the 7-8 year period. A change of 1 in BMI means that the person gained around 4-8 pounds, depending on their height. 
I intend to compare the change in weight for those who had no diet drinks to the change in weight for those who did have diet drinks.
